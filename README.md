# High-performance computing with Message Passing Interface (MPI) for testing nmatrix multiplication

In this project, there is an approach to matrix multiplication testing.
It will use high-performance computing with Message Passing Interface (MPI).

All tests were run on 64-bit [*PelicanHPC GNU/Linux*](https://pelicanhpc.org/) operating system with [*Open MPI*](https://www.open-mpi.org/) (version 1.6.5) installed. The cluster was made of three nodes running inside [*Oracle VM VirtualBox*](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual machines on a laptop computer with Intel® Core™ i7-6700HQ processor.
